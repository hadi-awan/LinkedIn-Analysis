# LinkedIn-Analysis

As an active user on LinkedIn, I was curious about the statistics of my network. In particular, I was wondering about these questions:
1) How is my Connection activity over time?
2) What field do the majority of my connections work in?
3) Which positions do my connections hold?

Getting my LinkedIn data
To analyze and visualize my network, the first step that I need to do is to get my LinkedIn data. Fortunately, LinkedIn is nice enough to make the process of downloading your own data fairly simple â€” no APIs are necessary. All I need to do is just select which data I want to get and it will be downloaded as a CSV file.

Now that I have my LinkedIn data, I can start analyzing and making visualizations using the data. 

Here are the results that I was able to retrieve after performing data visualization:

1) Connection Timeline

2) Bar graph for companies that my connections are working at:

3) The various positions occupied by my connections
