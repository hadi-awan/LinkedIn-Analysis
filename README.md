# LinkedIn-Analysis

As an active user on LinkedIn, I was curious about the statistics of my network. In particular, I was wondering about these questions:
1) What are the segments of people in my network?
2) What field do the majority of my connections work in?

Getting my LinkedIn data
To analyze and visualize my network, the first step that I need to do is to get my LinkedIn data. Fortunately, LinkedIn is nice enough to make the process of downloading your own data fairly simple â€” no APIs are necessary. All I need to do is just select which data I want to get and it will be downloaded as a CSV file.
